channels:
  - pytorch
  - conda-forge
  - defaults
dependencies:
  # Core Python & Data
  - python=3.10  # 3.10 is very stable for RL libraries currently
  - numpy
  - pandas
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn

  # RL & AI Frameworks
  - gymnasium  # The standard for creating the environment
  - pytorch    # The Deep Learning engine (CPU version is fine for Azul)
  - stable-baselines3 # Pre-built RL algorithms (PPO, DQN, etc.)

  # Development Tools
  - ipykernel  # To run Notebooks in VS Code
  - jupyter
  - tqdm       # Progress bars for training loops
  - black      # Code formatter (essential for clean code)
  - pytest     # We need to test the game logic rigorously

  # Pip fallback (just in case)
  - pip
  - pip:
      - shimmy>=0.2.1  # often needed for gymnasium compatibility
